    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Irish-inspired breakfast, brunch or alternative side dish is based on 'boxty', or potato cakes</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>140g floury potatoes (weighed after peeling), cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>50g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>5 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>3 spring onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp sunflower oil, plus extra if needed</li>
        <li>knob of butter</li>
        <li>6 rashers streaky bacon (smoked or unsmoked)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the potatoes in a large pan of salted water and boil until tender. Drain well, tip back into the pan, shake for 1 min over a gentle heat to dry them off, then mash and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Put the cooled mash in a bowl with the flour and bicarb. Whisk 1 egg with the milk, season, tip into the bowl and whisk until smooth. Stir in the spring onions, reserving some to serve.</li>
        <li>In a non-stick frying pan, heat half the oil and butter until sizzling, then spoon in half the pancake batter to make 3 pancakes. Cook for 1 min or so on each side until browned and set underneath, then flip and cook the other side. Keep warm in the oven while you make 3 more pancakes.</li>
        <li>Wipe out the pan, add the bacon and sizzle until almost crisp. Push to one side and crack in the 2 remaining eggs – with a splash more oil if needed. Fry to your liking, then serve with the pancakes and bacon, sprinkled with the remaining spring onions.</li>
    </ol>
